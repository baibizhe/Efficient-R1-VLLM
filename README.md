is the **first project** to apply **reward-based reinforcement learning (GRPO)** to finetune **DeepSeek2-VL**, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model, for multimodal reasoning tasks. We focus on optimizing training efficiency via **SGLang-accelerated rollouts** while maintaining the modelâ€™s reasoning capabilities.

*Pipeline: Vision-Language Input â†’ DeepSeek2-VL MoE â†’ GRPO Reward Optimization â†’ Reasoning Output*

## ðŸ”¥ Key Innovations  
1. **First RL-Tuned MoE for Vision-Language**  
   - Pioneer reinforcement learning adaptation of **DeepSeek2-VL-MoE** (8x experts) on complex vision-language datasets (e.g., ScienceQA, VCR).  
2. **SGLang-Optimized Rollouts**  
   - Achieve **1.7 xfaster trajectory sampling** by integrating [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) with DeepSeek2-VLâ€™s official codebase.  
3. **GRPO Training Framework**  
   - Customized reward functions for **reasoning alignment** (correctness, coherence, step-by-step validity).  

## ðŸš€ Quick Start  
code will come soon .
